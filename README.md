# Purpose

I asked myself, how would Discord be if it was built in Tauri? I could only imagine super low memory usage so I got a PoC working in a week.

This project's purpose is to, not only know how Discord would be if it was built in Tauri; but also learn about Discord's inner workings and possibly get more people to know about [Tauri](https://tauri.studio)!

# Benchmarks

Made with same procedure and in the same system (WINDOWS).

Your results will probably vary, this benchmark was taken years ago.

If these results are good, they are thanks to Tauri, not because the Discord dev team is bad.

If these results are bad, Tauri is still a great library! Also, good job Discord!

| Detail                         | Discord Tauri | Discord   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | --------- |
| Installer Size                 | 2.83 MiB      | 67.57 MiB |
| Installed Size (without Cache) | 20 MiB        | 326 MiB   |
| Max. Memory Usage              | 650 MB        | 630 MB    |
| Avg. Memory Usage (after load) | 550 MB        | 535 MB    |
| Min. Memory Usage (after load) | 500 MB        | 490 MB    |
| Launch Time                    | 5.08s         | 7.41s     |

The following results were obtained with an almost brand new account: 3 servers, 1 friend.

# FAQ

### What is Discord Tauri?
It's a Discord wrapper that uses the lightweight library [Tauri](https://tauri.studio). In the current state of development, we are replicating the original Discord client behavior.

### Is this against Discord's ToS?
Yes. Every Discord mod is against the ToS, altough, it seems like Discord still doesn't care too much about it. Quoting [Wired's article about BetterDiscord](https://www.wired.com/story/betterdiscord-lets-users-mod-chat-app/): "BetterDiscord is not an officially sanctioned app; and likely it breaks Discordâ€™s terms of service, which prohibit modifying Discord. But the software has been installed more than 5.3 million times since 2015, and its developers say they have not seen Discord take action against users for modifying the client".

### Is this project abandoned?
No. But I'm a student and it's hard to add features and fix bugs while having to do homework.

### Wait, this isn't that lightweight. What's up with that?
Well, think of Tauri and Electron as browsers. When you have some app like Discord, that has a lot of images, the RAM usage goes crazy. The only way to create a "really lightweight" Discord client would be to make a native interface in something like Qt.
